Capstone Preliminary Ideas

In general my objective is to have a down to earth, pratical, yet useful capstone that can help showcase my talents to future employers. 
I ultimately want to show that I can help them make better business decisions, make more money, and provide more value to their customers.

1. Youtube trending video. Plenty of different datasets for youtube out there.  Condense data down to bare minimum and try to predict if 
a video will go viral.  
Another idea with youtube data would be to acquire data about kids channels (or all channels in general) and try to predict whether
a channel will be blocked or not.  May be hard to acquire that data, relevant to me as I have kids and Youtube Kids is out of control 
with total rubbish targeted at our youth.  Youtube has taken measurements but it would be best to not wait until flags are thrown and be 
able to predict or detect early stages of a channel with inappropriate content.

2. Identify fraudulent transactions.  I am a victim of identity theft and am amazed to watch banks simply investigate and bury the issue, 
then lose the money that was fraudulently withdrawn.  I would love to try my hat at identifying the fraud and remember wanting to do this 
when the bank accounts were being used in my name.

3. Car loan default prediction.  THe data looks clean but would take some processing and there seems to be a lot of data that could be useful 
and even more that is most likely extraneous.  There appears to be some outliers on in the load amount that I would probably remove as they 
don't fall within a realistic car loan.

4. USA Statistics, age, gender, debt, income, rent/mortgage, etc.  Data looked interesting but am not sure about what to glean from the data.
